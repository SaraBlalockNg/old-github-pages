## Welcome to GitHub Pages
You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/SaraBlalockNg/sarablalockng.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.
Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.
### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes
Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/SaraBlalockNg/sarablalockng.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

# About me

I am a fifth-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Linguistics at the University of Washington under the advisement of Drs. Richard Wright and Mari Ostendorf. My research focuses on issues in computational models of prosody.  I am especially interested in how natural language understanding can be augmented with prosodic information, such as the kind produced by disfluency dedection and dialogue state modeling.  I use theory-agnostic, engineering approaches with grounding in attested generalities of language acoustics.

I received a B.S. in Applied Mathematics and an Honors B.A. in Linguistics in 2017 from the University of Utah.  I received a certification in Teaching English to Students of Other Languages (TESOL) from the Univeristy of Utah in 2016.  I was accepted as a Ph.D. student at UW in 2017.

My CV can be found [here]("docs/ng_CV.pdf").

My resume can be found [here]("docs/ng_resume.pdf").
