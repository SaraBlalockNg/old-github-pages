<!--Teaching is my first love, and I came to linguistics through the English as a Second Language (ESL) Teaching program at the University of Utah.-->I find real passion in teaching, and am working to improve my teaching and mentoring abilities while in graduate school.  I actually discovered the field of linguistics while completing the English as a Second Language Teaching program at the University of Utah.  As an undergraduate, I was a student teacher of Intermediate ESL and Content ESL Math and Science at Cottonwood High School in Salt Lake City, Utah.  I also was a teaching instructor for language and assimilation tutors at Catholic Community Services.

As a graduate student at UW, I am a TA for various Linguistics and Computer Science courses.  My teaching evaluations are [here]("docs/teaching_evals.pdf").  <!--I also have <a href="docs/teaching_goals.html">ongoing goals for improving student outcomes</a>.-->
